# Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects
The projects presented are used to achieve a better understanding of programing and how to understand how to PlutoX works. The projects will utilize the sensors in conjunction with the LEDs on the flight controller to demonstrate the output of each projects. Some of these projects will involve the drone taking flight while performing a task. 

Project 1) [DebuggingAPI](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/DebuggingAPI):
This projects allows us to get practice and a understanding of how the sensors and LED can be utilized. This code utilizes the accelerometer and the LEDs located on the Flight controller to indicate when the drone is moving along the positive or negative Z axis.

Project 2) [Chuck to arm](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/Chuck_to_arm):
This project was designed to allow us to practice our coding skills and working with the accelerometer. The purpose of the project is to arm the drone when it experiences free fall to keep it from crashing. 

Project 3) [Flying modes](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/Fly_Acro):
This project will help us test the different flight modes available on the PlutoX drone with the help of the gyro sensor. The modes can be switched by activating/disactivating the developer mode.
