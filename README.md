# Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects
The projects presented are used to achieve a better understanding of programing and how to understand how to PlutoX works. The projects will utilize the sensors in conjunction with the LEDs on the flight controller to demonstrate the output of each projects. Some of these projects will involve the drone taking flight while performing a task. 

Project 1) [DebuggingAPI](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/DebuggingAPI):
This projects allows us to get practice and a understanding of how the sensors and LED can be utilized. This code utilizes the accelerometer and the LEDs located on the Flight controller to indicate when the drone is moving along the positive or negative Z axis.

Project 2) [Chuck to arm](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/Chuck_to_arm):
This project was designed to allow us to practice our coding skills and working with the accelerometer. The purpose of the project is to arm the drone when it experiences free fall to keep it from crashing. 

Project 3) [Flying modes](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/Fly_Acro):
This project will help us test the different flight modes available on the PlutoX drone with the help of the gyro sensor. The modes can be switched by activating/disactivating the developer mode.

Project 4) [Open sesame](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/Open_Sesame_Main):
This project allows us to expand our knowledge on how barometers work. In this project, the drone is to ascend when it has detected a change in pressure in the atmosphere. If the pressure has been changed, the drone will ascend and pressure changes will be displayed on the IDE of the PlutoX.

Project 5) [Temperature reactive drone](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/Temperature_reactive_drone):
This project will consist of working with the barometer but it will be used to determine the temperature of its surrounding area. The LED on the drone will change when it has experience a change in temperature while the IDE monitor will display a value representing the initial temperature and will change depending on the temperature.

Project 6) [Turtle flip](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/Turtle_flip):
The following project allows the drone to flip to its starting position when it detects that the drone is upside down. We will be able to fly the drone normally once it has flipped right side up. The program allows two of its propellers to help correct the orientation of the drone.
