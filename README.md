# Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects
The projects presented are used to achieve a better understanding of programing and how to understand how to PlutoX works. The projects will utilize the sensors in conjunction with the LEDs on the flight controller to demonstrate the output of each projects. Some of these projects will involve the drone taking flight while performing a task. Images and video of these tasks will be provided when the project has been completed and tested.

Project 1: [DebuggingAPI](https://github.com/DavidCeniceros87/Understanding-and-configuring-PlutoX-projects/blob/main/DebuggingAPI):
This projects allows us to get practice and a understanding of how the sensors and LED can be utilized. This code utilizes the accelerometer and the LEDs located on the Flight controller to indicate when the drone is moving along the positive or negative Z axis.
